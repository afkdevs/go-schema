# Schema

Schema is a fluent, expressive Go library for generating and executing DDL SQL (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`) within Go code â€” ideal for use with migration tools like [Goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose).

Inspired by Laravel's schema builder, Schema simplifies defining and evolving database schemas using idiomatic Go.
